# Comparing Household Income in Baltimore, MD and Nassau County, NY with Opportunity Atlas Data
## Background

The metric of household income is an important contributor to many different aspects of life. An [editorial by the Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html) provided arguments for how a focus on poverty in Baltimore could possibly solve a wide array of the issues in the city. The article mentions that multiple issues in the city can be correlated to poverty. For instance, people may turn to crimes like burglary at a higher rate if they have less economic security, and feel the need to engage in it for financial reasons. Moreover, The Baltimore City Health Department that poverty has been correlated with health issues as well. The article states that “people in low-income neighborhoods such as Upton Druid Heights consistently have more health problems … than people in wealthier areas such as Roland Park.” Even within Baltimore, it seems that location and financial situation in the area plays a role. 

According to an [article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-poverty.html), household income could be affected by the location of the individual when they were a child. It provides information on the notion that location plays a role in the American dream. According to a study in the article, it “f[ound] that poor children who grow up in some cities and towns have sharply better odds of escaping poverty than similar poor children elsewhere.” 

A deeper look into the household incomes of vastly different location could provide greater insights  An analysis of Nassau County, NY and Baltimore, MD, two locations with very different socioeconomic scenes, will allow the ability to analyze how location may affect the financial status of children. Having grown up in Nassau County, I had often heard and personally felt the relatively wealthiness of where I lived. Resting around 50 minutes outside New York City, it has a median household income of [$116,304](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/nassau-county-ny). On the other hand, Baltimore has a median household income of $76,182. In the United States, as a whole, the median household income is $61,937.

A look into Open Data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) for household income will provide the means to explore how the financial trajectory of individuals in adulthood may be correlated with their parents' income and location at which they grew up.

## Data Analysis 
Microsoft Excel was used to help further provide color on the problem and potential avenues to solving it.

No one who grew up in Nassau County, regardless of the income of the parents, were living in poverty in adulthood. According to my data, Baltimore was similar to Nassau in that it also had virtually no levels of poverty for those who grew up with parents with incomes higher than the 25th percentile. However, for those with parents' income in the 25th percentile or less, 75% ended up in poverty when they were adults. This demonstrates that getting parents in the 50th percentile made a big difference for those in Baltimore. Looking at how to get more people at that level could help result in lower percentages of adults in poverty. 

Upon looking at the combined bar graph, you can see that the both the mean and median are higher in Nassau than in Baltimore. Sometimes the values for a mean can be skewed by outliers, but the fact that both the mean and median here are higher in Nassau than in Baltimore demonstrates its consistency. It highlights the need for reform, and how looking into some of the initiatives and opportunities that are created by living in Nassau could help develop Baltimore-centric solutions for the issue of poverty.

Both pivot charts show that there are pockets in both locations where household income is lower across all parent income distributions. This provides a direction of where to potentially concentrating resources for maximum benefit in the future. 

## Summary
Overall household income is higher for those who live in Nassau, regardless of parents' income. Thus, location played a big role. Given the importance of household income in different aspects of life, including health and future security, the analysis provides a direction for which to start. 

Based on my analysis, focusing on different pockets of Baltimore that are more significantly lower in terms of household income could be an efficient method of target issues of poverty. Furthermore, deetermining what Nassau might do or have that could result in higher household incomes could be another way of figuring out Baltimore-centric solutions. Finally, focusing on getting people within the middle 50th percentile in terms of income could help with future issues of poverty.

Some additional data that is helpful to build on these findings. More data on who exactly they were studying. Because sources state that the median household income for Nassau is over $100,000. It shows that it is lower according to this data. A deeper dive into the discrepancies would be insightful.

This is important for me because
