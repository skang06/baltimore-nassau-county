# Comparing Household Income in Baltimore, MD and Nassau County, NY with Opportunity Atlas Data
## Background
An article in the New York Times provides information on the notion that location plays a role in the American dream. According to “earnings records of millions of families that moved with children,” a study “f[ound] that poor children who grow up in some cities and towns have sharply better odds of escaping poverty than similar poor children elsewhere.”

An analysis of Nassau County, NY and Baltimore, MD, two locations with very different socioeconomic scenes, will allow the ability to analyze the effect of location on children. Having grown up in Nassau County (1.36M), I had often heard and personally felt the relatively wealthiness of my county. Resting around 50 minutes outside New York City, it has a median household income of $116,304 (https://datausa.io/profile/geo/nassau-county-ny). It has a population of around 1.3 M people. On the other hand, Baltimore has a median household income of $76,182, with a population of around 800,000 people. The median household income in the United States is $61,937.

It would be insightful to see the actual differences in household income during adulthood for children who grew up in vastly different socioeconomic locations. Household income is an important contributor to many different aspects of life. An editorial by the Baltimore Sun (LINK HERE- https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html) provided arguments for how a focus on poverty could possibly solve a wide array of the issues in the city. The article mentions that multiple issues in the city can be correlated to poverty. For instance, people may turn to crimes like burglary at a higher rate if they have less economic security, and feel the need to engage in it for financial reasons. Moreover, The Baltimore City Health Department that poverty has been correlated with health issues as well. The article states that “people in low-income neighborhoods such as Upton Druid Heights consistently have more health problems … than people in wealthier areas such as Roland Park.” Even within Baltimore, it seems that location and financial situation in the area plays a role. 

A deeper look into a vastly different location could provide greater insights. Thus, a look into Open Data from Opportunity Atlas (LINK HERE) will help explore how many adults end up in poverty that grew up in homes of parents with different income brackets could draw a correlation between how location plays a significant role.
