# Comparing Household Income in Baltimore, MD and Nassau County, NY with Opportunity Atlas Data
## Background
An [article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-poverty.html) provides information on the notion that location plays a role in the American dream. According to “earnings records of millions of families that moved with children,” a study “f[ound] that poor children who grow up in some cities and towns have sharply better odds of escaping poverty than similar poor children elsewhere.”

An analysis of Nassau County, NY and Baltimore, MD, two locations with very different socioeconomic scenes, will allow the ability to analyze the effect of location on children. Having grown up in Nassau County (1.36M), I had often heard and personally felt the relatively wealthiness of my county. Resting around 50 minutes outside New York City, it has a median household income of [$116,304] (https://datausa.io/profile/geo/nassau-county-ny). It has a population of around 1.3 M people. On the other hand, Baltimore has a median household income of $76,182, with a population of around 800,000 people. The median household income in the United States is $61,937.

It would be insightful to see the actual differences in household income during adulthood for children who grew up in vastly different socioeconomic locations. Household income is an important contributor to many different aspects of life. An [editorial by the Baltimore Sun (https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html ) provided arguments for how a focus on poverty could possibly solve a wide array of the issues in the city. The article mentions that multiple issues in the city can be correlated to poverty. For instance, people may turn to crimes like burglary at a higher rate if they have less economic security, and feel the need to engage in it for financial reasons. Moreover, The Baltimore City Health Department that poverty has been correlated with health issues as well. The article states that “people in low-income neighborhoods such as Upton Druid Heights consistently have more health problems … than people in wealthier areas such as Roland Park.” Even within Baltimore, it seems that location and financial situation in the area plays a role. 

A deeper look into a vastly different location could provide greater insights. Thus, a look into Open Data from [Opportunity Atlas] (https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) will help explore how many adults end up in poverty that grew up in homes of parents with different income brackets could draw a correlation between how location plays a significant role. 
## Business Question
How can location and parent’s income help with upward mobility and poverty in adulthood?
## Open Data 
1.	Opportunity Insights:
- LINK: this dataset contains data about household income for {NUMBER} children who had parents in the bottom 25th percentile.
- this dataset contains data about household income for {} children who had parents in the middle 50th percentile.
- this dataset contains data about household income for {} children who had parents in the top 75th percentile.
## Data Analysis 
Upon comparing the two bar graphs you can see that those who grew up in Nassau County had virtually no one in poverty across the different parent income distributions. However, Baltimore had virtually 75% of adults who had parents in the 25th percentile end up in poverty when they were adults. That percentage decreased by more than half (25% in poverty)for those whose parents were in the 50th percentile. This demonstrated that getting parents in the 50th percentile made a big difference.

In addition, it is interesting to note that there was a higher standard deviation for Nassau than Baltimore. This could go to show the 
It could also indicate that Baltimore
## Summary
According to the analysis on poverty and different parent income distributions, it can help us form actions for the future. What actions you can take that perhaps benefits Nassau to have such low rates of poverty that can be applied to Baltimore, so to get more residents in the 50th percentile range. Just getting people to have their income in the 50th percentile makes a big difference according to the poverty rates gleaned from the available data. 

Some additional data that is helpful to build on these findings. More data on who exactly they were studying. Because sources state that the median household income for Nassau is over $100,000. It shows that it is lower according to this data. A deeper dive into the discrepancies would be insightful.


There may be aspects I already have witnessed from my hometown that I could use to help brainstorm some Baltimore-centric solutions.
